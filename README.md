# NARI
The purpose of developing a NARI is to make a one stop destination for all women hygiene products and their awareness in the public. This website also helps in keeping track of oneâ€™s menstrual cycle. Another purpose for developing this project is to help the women get in contact with their nearest gynecologist/doctors and get their worries/all their doubts cleared away anytime. 
There were many functionalities available on the portal including Awareness where in period myths, different period products etc were listed for educational purposes. Then there was a period tracker, etc.
